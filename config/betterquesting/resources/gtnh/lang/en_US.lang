betterquesting.btn.help6=Themes
betterquesting.btn.help7=Localization
betterquesting.btn.help8=Resources

betterquesting.help.page1=§l§nGeneral Navigation%n§r%nBetter Questing's main questing GUIs do not rely on an item or block that could be easily lost but instead through a single keybinding which can be found and changed through the controls menu.%n%nIn the Quest Lines screen you can select any of your active lines from the list and drag around the box to navigate to the quest of your choosing to begin completing tasks.%n%nQuesting parties can be created or edited via the Party Management screens. Here you can also toggle options for sharing hardcore lives or quest rewards.%n%nIf you'd like to change the look of your questing UIs you can choose from the currently installed themes in the Theme selection screen.
betterquesting.help.page2=§l§nSubmission Station%n§r%nAlthough many of the questing tasks can be submitted directly through your inventory (including liquids) sometimes you need a more automated solution. This is where the Object Submission Station (OSS) comes in handy. Tasks supporting the OSS can be selected through the built in interface to enable its use. Once setup, liquids and items can be either piped in or dropped into the interface's input slot however it will not void items or liquids if no task is selected or if it has already been completed making it relatively safe from accidental item/fluid deletion. Multiple OSS are also capable of taking on separate sub-tasks under the same quest simultaneously!
betterquesting.help.page3=§l§nMaking Quests%n§r%nTo begin making quests and quest lines you will first have to enable edit mode by running the edit command (See commands for more info). You will then be able to add or remove quest lines however you do not require one to begin making quests. This is especially handy if you'd like to make secret quests that unlock other quests or quest lines.%n%nThere are several menus you will need to become familiar with while editing. These will be a little overwhelming at first compared to most other mods but over time it will get easier. Some advanced editing screens will edit raw questing data so you'd want to be very careful what you change as it could have adverse side effects however this should never result in corruption or a crash. If either occurs than you should immediately report it to a developer.
betterquesting.help.page4=§l§nCommands%n§r%nThere are only a handful of commands you need to know when working with Better Questing. They are separated into user commands that anyone can run and admin commands which are restricted to server operators.%n%n§o/bq_user refresh%n§r%nManually resyncs the local questing database with the server in case of potential desync issues.%n%n§o/bq_user help%n§r%nGives the player a copy of this guide%n%n§o/bq_admin edit%n§r%nToggles quest editing mode on and off. When enabled, operators will be able to access the editing menus for quests and quest lines. Remember to disable this before publishing packs or quests.%n%n§o/bq_admin hardcore%n§r%nToggles on and off the use of hardcore lives. When all lives have been depleted, players will be banned from the server or have their world deleted as per standard vanilla hardcore.%n%n§o/bq_admin reset [all|<quest_id>] [username|uuid]%n§r%nErases quest completion data for the given user. Handy to use before publishing packs.%n%n§o/bq_admin default [save|load]%n§r%nSaves/loads the current quest database to/from the global default directory. Setting defaults means any newly created worlds will start with that particular set of quests. Saving will also preserve completion data, hardcore state and edit mode so be sure to use the various other command as necessary before running this one.%n%n§o/bq_admin complete <quest_id> [username|uuid]%n§r%nForce completes a quest for the given user%n%n§o/bq_admin delete [all|<quest_id>]%n§r%nDeletes given quest(s) and progression data however it does not delete new world defaults.%n%n§o/bq_admin lives [add|set|max|default] <value> [username]%n§r%nThese commands change the amount of lives players have or the starting and max values.
betterquesting.help.page5=§l§nImporting%n§r%nSome expansion packs may include importers for other questing mods or allow pack makers to download online quest lines. To access these importers you can click on the 'Import' button in the main quest line editor. By default Better Questing does not have any importers so if you require a specific importer you'll need to either find an expansion with one or make it yourself.
betterquesting.help.page6=§l§nThemes%n§r%nIf you're someone who prefers a certain color pallet in their UIs or are just a pack maker wanting to give it that more authentic look and feel then themes are your best friend. Themes can change the look of the questing UIs to suit whatever your needs may be whether it be futuristic, magical or just classic Minecraft. They can be installed either through resource packs, resource directory or via expansions packs.
betterquesting.help.page7=§l§nLocalization%n§r%nBetter Questing supports full localization of quest names and descriptions so that if you wanted to release your pack to users of all nationalities now you now can! In order to begin localizing your quests you'll need to use unique keys such as "§omypack.quest1.name§r" instead of plain text. You can then create a resource pack containing only .lang files for all the language specific translations. These files can alternatively be stored in Better Questing's resource directory for better bundling in packs
betterquesting.help.page8=§l§nResources%n§r%nIf you want to customise the home screen, bundle themes or add localization files then you can do so through: %n%n"§o/config/betterquesting/resources/<pack_name>/§r"%n%nAny folders here can be treated as unlisted resource packs containing everything required to personalize your pack.

#Tier 0 - It begins
#name
tier0.name=Tier 0 - It begins
#description
tier0.desc=The very first tier, tier zero. This chapter will introduce you to the basic mechanics of this modpack. Mods covered: Vanilla, Pam's Harvestcraft.

########
#Quests#
########

#Your first night
#name
tier0.quest1.name=Your first night
#description
tier0.quest1.desc=Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...

#Sticks 'n Stones
#name
tier0.quest2.name=Sticks 'n Stones
#description
tier0.quest2.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! Most probably you will read this text while you are waiting for the night to be over. Once it is, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)

#Where is the flint?
#name
tier0.quest3.name=Where is the flint?
#description
tier0.quest3.desc=As you might have noticed, while collecting gravel, no flint dropped for you. Well, there is a... recipe for that. Look up flint in NEI and craft some!

#Crafting time
#name
tier0.quest4.name=Crafting time
#description
tier0.quest4.desc=It's time to get yourself a 3x3 crafting area. Grab some flint and some wood, and build one!

#Main Quests and Secondary Quests
#name
tier0.quest5.name=Main Quests and Secondary Quests
#description
tier0.quest5.desc=Now that you have made it this far notice the two new quests. See how these two quests look different? The quest with a crown is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nNot all main quests have a connecting line to guide you through your adventure because of book size. If there is not an obvious linked main quest at any point, try completing some of the other main quests available to you to progress.

#Storage for days
#name
tier0.quest6.name=Storage for days
#description
tier0.quest6.desc=Now that you've unlocked 3x3 crafting, it's about time to make some storage for your goods. Take some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks and 1 flint.

#Bamboo fence
#name
tier0.quest7.name=Bamboo fence
#description
tier0.quest7.desc=Maybe you are lucky and start off in a bamboo forest.%nBamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you place bamboo sticks they will grow and protect your base behind a 3 block tall wall.%nAlternatively, you can also use Berry Bushes.

#Tools
#name
tier0.quest8.name=Tools
#description
tier0.quest8.desc=Now that you've got a shelter, crafting table, and a place to store your items, you should make some tools. (Unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hand...)

#You reap...
#name
tier0.quest9.name=You reap...
#description
tier0.quest9.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.

#Collecting some berries
#name
tier0.quest10.name=Collecting some berries
#description
tier0.quest10.desc=Are you now waiting for the carrots to grow? Go and find some berry bushes and berries. The berries are a good source of food and you can put these bushes around your house to make a wall. It should provide a good protection against all those monsters that want to come into your house and kill you.

#Berry medley
#name
tier0.quest11.name=Berry medley
#description
tier0.quest11.desc=Hmmm... what can you do with all those berries? Just eating? You will see that they have a very low saturation Level. Let's plant the new berry bushes and mix the berries to make some better food.

#Oak trees are not apple trees
#name
tier0.quest12.name=Oak trees are not apple trees
#description
tier0.quest12.desc=Oak trees which give apples?  Who the hell added this to minecraft? You find a way of combining an oak sapling and an apple to get an apple tree sapling. Try to plant one to get a permanent source of food.

#Monster trap
#name
tier0.quest13.name=Monster trap
#description
tier0.quest13.desc=If you're lucky you spawn in a sand or rainforest biome and find some quicksand. Collect a stack of the stuff, dig a small ditch and fill it with the quicksand to protect your "dirt base" home.

#Get that stone
#name
tier0.quest14.name=Get that stone
#description
tier0.quest14.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! Time to mine some cobblestone. Yay! (And maybe you can improve this dirt-hut too...)

#Can you hear the carrots grow?
#name
tier0.quest15.name=Can you hear the carrots grow?
#description
tier0.quest15.desc=Tired of waiting since your carrots grow sooooo slow... ?%nWell I got an idea, bone meal will help you grow food in seconds. Ok, chop down some trees and I will trade you some bone meal.

#Your first long range weapon
#name
tier0.quest16.name=Your first long range weapon
#description
tier0.quest16.desc=Since you can't make any vanilla bow before LV and Tinkers weapons are not in this Tier you find a way to make a spear out of sticks, leather and a string. Get one because some infernal monsters are easier to kill with a long range weapon.

#Sharpness: Over... 5...
#name
tier0.quest17.name=Sharpness: Over... 5...
#description
tier0.quest17.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!

#Fire, fire, Grandpa!
#name
tier0.quest18.name=Fire, fire, Grandpa!
#description
tier0.quest18.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon(tm).

#"Backed" potatoes
#name
tier0.quest19.name="Backed" potatoes
#description
tier0.quest19.desc=Eating raw potatoes isn't that healthy, as you might have noticed. Some potatoes are green and poisonous already. After you get a furnace you can make delicious baked potatoes as another food alternative. Put a baked potato on a stick to make it even more delicious.

#Food variants
#name
tier0.quest20.name=Food variants
#description
tier0.quest20.desc=Maybe you noticed already that eating the same food too often is very boring and not healthy any more. Some food like tea leaf can be taken to the furnace and processed further. So take a break and drink a cup of tea. Maybe munch some tasty raisins as they are very nice.

#...what you sow
#name
tier0.quest21.name=...what you sow
#description
tier0.quest21.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrot I gave you, then you're fine. Meanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

#Shield update
#name
tier0.quest22.name=Shield update
#description
tier0.quest22.desc=Your wooden shield is very weak. So you look for a better one. Looks like you need some leather, so go and find some cows.

#Shields UP
#name
tier0.quest23.name=Shields UP
#description
tier0.quest23.desc=With a sword in one hand, what can you do with the other? Right, you need a shield. Let's make one.

#Soft mallet adventure
#name
tier0.quest24.name=Soft mallet adventure
#description
tier0.quest24.desc=You now have some melon slices or pumpkins but what can you do with them? Well just eat them or... use a mallet to get some seeds... OK, let's craft one. Perhaps you can use this mallet for some other things too.

#Rest in pieces
#name
tier0.quest25.name=Rest in pieces
#description
tier0.quest25.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful...)

#Fluffy and red
#name
tier0.quest26.name=Fluffy and red
#description
tier0.quest26.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

#What is that...?
#name
tier0.quest27.name=What is that...?
#description
tier0.quest27.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal.

#SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
#name
tier0.quest28.name=SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
#description
tier0.quest28.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of Tier 0. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 1!

#Tier 0.5 - Stone Age
#name
tier0.5.name=Tier 0.5 - Stone Age
#description
tier0.5.desc=Basically the "Tier 0" of all your progression. This set helps you through the first tier until you can build your first steam machine

########
#Quests#
########

#Even More Compact Storage
#name
tier0.5.quest1.name=Even More Compact Storage
#description
tier0.5.quest1.desc=If you found enough gold you can upgrade your chest to make it an even bigger inventory of 9x9. You can just build a new chest or upgrade the iron chest with a wood to gold chest upgrade item.

#GT 6 styled Pipes
#name
tier0.5.quest2.name=GT 6 styled Pipes
#description
tier0.5.quest2.desc=Maybe you are wondering why the new pipes don't auto-connect anymore? This was changed to make the pipe smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore. Shift clicking on the end of a pipe will disable the fluid input on that side. This is super handy, for example, to prevent coal boilers from feeding back steam into water pipes.%n%nHint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

#Looting II
#name
tier0.5.quest3.name=Looting II
#description
tier0.5.quest3.desc=The butchers knife from gt have looting 2. Go and find some treasures during your nightly monster slaying.

#More Compact Storage
#name
tier0.5.quest4.name=More Compact Storage
#description
tier0.5.quest4.desc=Now that you are starting to find more and more iron and you feel your wood chests are too small to hold all the stuff you found and collected. Now it's time to upgrade your chests to iron chests. You can just build a new chest or upgrade the wood chest with a wood to iron chest upgrade item.

#Chad a better way to make Paper
#name
tier0.5.quest5.name=Chad a better way to make Paper
#description
tier0.5.quest5.desc=Making paper out of wood pulp and water can be tedious and difficult. Why not using some sugar cane macerate it down to chad and press it with two stone plates to paper? Later on you can use the chemical bath for a even better ratio.

#You shall proceed
#name
tier0.5.quest6.name=You shall proceed
#description
tier0.5.quest6.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.

#Making bronze
#name
tier0.5.quest7.name=Making bronze
#description
tier0.5.quest7.desc=Now that you've found copper and tin, you should make yourself some bronze. Use your macer... mortar to grind up some copper and tin ingots, and mix them together!

#Animal farms
#name
tier0.5.quest8.name=Animal farms
#description
tier0.5.quest8.desc=Trying to get some leather or wool? You probably need to spend a lot of time hunting animals and traveling around, or you coul simply make a farm to get a decent amount of leather, wool and meat.

#Sheep hairdresser
#name
tier0.5.quest9.name=Sheep hairdresser
#description
tier0.5.quest9.desc=Killing sheep to get the wool is so ineffective. Making some shears would make sense if you need more wool.

#Important tools
#name
tier0.5.quest10.name=Important tools
#description
tier0.5.quest10.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.%n%nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.

#Tanned leather
#name
tier0.5.quest11.name=Tanned leather
#description
tier0.5.quest11.desc=You have found a way to make leather more durable and more resistant by further processing it. Make some bound leather from four pieces of leather, some strings and a woven cotton. Now you only have to hang it on a drying rack and wait about 10 minutes to get some tanned leather.

#Need more space?
#name
tier0.5.quest12.name=Need more space?
#description
tier0.5.quest12.desc=As you might know: tanned leather is more resistant and good enough for a backpack. Let's get a digger's backpack and a miner's backpack. Each pack holds different items. So use both for your first true back-packed mining experience.

#You need them all!
#name
tier0.5.quest13.name=You need them all!
#description
tier0.5.quest13.desc=There are many more backpacks: Hunter, builder, forester...

#Basic processing
#name
tier0.5.quest14.name=Basic processing
#description
tier0.5.quest14.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

#Ready, set, go!
#name
tier0.5.quest15.name=Ready, set, go!
#description
tier0.5.quest15.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this lunch bag, it will help you store some of your foods. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

#Gardener
#name
tier0.5.quest16.name=Gardener
#description
tier0.5.quest16.desc=If you are wondering: Why do I never get seeds when destroying grass? You are right. Try to work with your new mattock on the grass blocks that do not have water anywhere nearby to find some seeds.

#Better storage
#name
tier0.5.quest17.name=Better storage
#description
tier0.5.quest17.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

#Sleeping outside
#name
tier0.5.quest18.name=Sleeping outside
#description
tier0.5.quest18.desc=Carrying the bed with you all the time the looks very funny. Why don't you craft a sleeping bag to stay outside without placing a bed and changing your spawn point. Be warned: If you play on a server then you'd better sleep below Y level 128, as nights are very cold in the mountains...

#Fallen from the sky
#name
tier0.5.quest19.name=Fallen from the sky

multiblock.goals.quest25.desc=Pumps are nice but you're going to reach a point where you will want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE oil. This multiblock will help with that but you will need to search for oil using a seismic prospector. You can find raw, light and heavy oil. There's also a chance to find natural gas.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch coresponding to the power tier. 

#Moooooore steam
#name
multiblock.goals.quest26.name=Moooooore steam
#description
multiblock.goals.quest26.desc=Stock up on titanium, it will be fun. A large titanium boiler produces 1600 litres of steam per tick. For this amount you need to choose the right rotors for your turbines. For example, 2 normal cobalt rotors will be just right. Optimal flow for such rotor is 800 liters per tick. If you have more than one boiler, you will need to make calculations in order to select the appropriate rotors.

#Less Power loss
#name
multiblock.goals.quest27.name=Less Power loss
#description
multiblock.goals.quest27.desc=When you reach MV tier you can make your own duct tape in case you have to move your multiblock machines around. Duct tape will fix all maintenance problems in any multiblock machine.

#EBF Infos
#name
multiblock.goals.quest28.name=EBF Infos
#description
multiblock.goals.quest28.desc=You can use a scanner to manually check how your EBF works, or you can make an informations panel from nuclear control and always see the status. Make a GT sensor kit and place the sensor card in your info panel. Enable it with a redstone signal.

#Compress all the things

multiblock.goals.quest29.desc=Martin's (DreamMasterXXL) favourite machine. Compress ALL the things! With explosives, of course.

#Compress all the things
#name
multiblock.goals.quest30.name=You smell like a distillery!
#description
multiblock.goals.quest30.desc=This bad boy will tremendously boost the by-products of your cracked fuel by multiplying them by 5. This way you can make industrial TNT, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and other plastics more efficiently.%n%nYou will also need this for your automated setups.

#Even more steam? Are you sure?
#name
multiblock.goals.quest31.name=Even more steam? Are you sure?
#description
multiblock.goals.quest31.desc=This boiler is the most efficient source of steam. It allows you to produce as much as 2000 litres of steam per tick. If you need more, then build a dual or even quad boiler.

#Still not enough charcoal?
#name
multiblock.goals.quest32.name=Still not enough charcoal?
#description
multiblock.goals.quest32.desc=This oven is the best way to get charcoal and creosote (x50 faster than Railcraft's coke oven) and other byproducts. You will need tons of bronze, iron and steel to build it, but it's worth it. Finally, it will be possible to dismantle the charcoal pit.%nWith Cupronickel coils the oven is a bit slowlier. Each coil tier speed up the charcoal production.

#Glyceryl trini...... what?
#name
multiblock.goals.quest33.name=Glyceryl trini...... what?
#description
multiblock.goals.quest33.desc=Kids, today we will make some glyceryl trinitrate with some glycerol.%n%n    - Chemistry 101

#Powderbarrels
#name
multiblock.goals.quest34.name=Powderbarrels
#description
multiblock.goals.quest34.desc=Powderbarrels are twice as good as dynamite in the implosion compressor. Craft one stack.

#TNT
#name
multiblock.goals.quest35.name=TNT
#description
multiblock.goals.quest35.desc=TNT is much more powerful than the powderbarrel but much harder to craft. There are LV and HV ways to craft. At LV you need heavy or light fuel to make some toluene wich can be solidified to gelled toluene. Alternatively you can use sugar and plastic dust in a chemical reactor to make toluene more efficient. Mix it with sulfuric acid to make TNT.%n%nThe HV way requires an oil cracking unit to make all kinds of cracked fuel or cracked naphta and a distillation tower to extract toluene from that.

#Let's get it crackin!
#name
multiblock.goals.quest36.name=Let's get it crackin!
#description
multiblock.goals.quest36.desc=Cracking oil will result in better by-products in the distillation tower. It is a smart idea to get this multiblock since you are going to need TONS of industrial TNT for advanced tier rockets.%n%nIf you add steam the amout of EU/t will be reduced by 50% and if you add hydrogen the output will be increased by 30%

#High speed charcoal
#name
multiblock.goals.quest37.name=High speed charcoal
#description
multiblock.goals.quest37.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish flammable stuff anyway...

#Upgrade #1: More heat
#name
multiblock.goals.quest38.name=Upgrade #1: More heat
#description
multiblock.goals.quest38.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. You can even recycle the old coils, how fancy is that!

#At the end of...
#name
multiblock.goals.quest39.name=At the end of...
#description
multiblock.goals.quest39.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the heat death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff. You will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.

#Dynamite
#name
multiblock.goals.quest40.name=Dynamite
#description
multiblock.goals.quest40.desc=Dynamite is the most basic explosive you can use in the implosion compressor.%nMix some paper, string and glyceryl trinitrate in a chemical reactor to get dynamite.

#iTNT
#name
multiblock.goals.quest41.name=iTNT
#description
multiblock.goals.quest41.desc=Industrial TNT is the HV variant of TNT. It explodes with more power, yet does not destroy blocks when it explodes.

#Cleanroom
#name
multiblock.goals.quest42.name=Cleanroom
#description
multiblock.goals.quest42.desc=If you want to make more advanced circuits you need a cleanroom. The cleanroom is a multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxDx) blocks. Besides plascrete blocks you need a controller, filter casings on the top, an energy and maintenance hatch , a reinforced door and three machine hulls. For now you can use MV tier.%n%nLet's build a 5x5x5 room.

#A very useful Scanner
#name
multiblock.goals.quest43.name=A very useful Scanner
#description
multiblock.goals.quest43.desc=The portable scanner is a tool capable of showing advanced information about almost every block in the game.%nIn order to function, the tool needs to be charged first. It can hold up to 400k EU and accept 128 EU/t or less. This is MV tier.%n%nIt can scan crops, which shows more information than the cropnalyzer does. The crop, which was scanned in the world, will drop a scanned seed bag.%nIt can scan machines from GregTech, giving information about current progress, the stored energy, efficiency, problems and CPU-load.%nFor any block in the game it scans, it gives information about its ID, Metadata, position in the world and hardness value.%nIt also gives information about pollution level in the chunk the scanned block belongs to.%nAdditional to that it shows when the clenroom has reached his 100% efficeny level.
